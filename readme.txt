The project is built using Maven and has a multi-module structure, divided in two parts: backend and frontend.
On the backend we use Spring Boot along with several technologies or dependencies:

-Spring JPA: to create our data model and interact with the common database.
-Apache POI: to handle the spreadsheets and export the data.
-UCanAccess: to be able to read the data of access databases.
-Jackson: as a mapper of those jsons we use on our requests to the server.
-And JWT + Spring Security: to authenticate and authorize requests and manage the security in general.
